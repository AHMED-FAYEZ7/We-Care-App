## Features

* Provids a free lift service from one place to another

* Contains two users, either a driver or a rider. 


Some of the cool features applied in the project:

* In the rider's case, he schedules his trip by choosing the pick-up and drop-off locations as well as the time and then selecting the proper journey for him to the same drop-off location.


* In the driver's case, he creates a new trip by selecting the pick-up and drop-off location, time, and number of available seats in his car, then he chooses carpoolers from the requests provided to him.


* Both the rider and the driver can get a live track for the trip, including real-time information on the distance and time remained.


Some external package used in the project:

* Flutter bloc(cubit)

* Email Verification to Authentication

* Firebase Auth and Firebase Cloud Firestore

* Real Time Changes from Firebase Cloud Firestore using Streams.

* Searching function by driver's name created manually

* Google maps flutter : to improve the user experience 

* Geolocator : Get the current location of user's device
